# Weather_App_With_API

Description: in this project, I’ve made an application from scratch that will display a five day weather forecast, as well as the current weather for the city that is inputted by the user in the search bar this app works by using an API that can fetch the data for the temperature and the wind in the given city and we use two different API to find the current weather as well as the five day forecast. I built the HTML, the CSS and the Java script for this project project has a search bar where a user will input the name of a city such as New York in the screenshot example and in our code we run a fetch call and using our API key we are able to Gather this data. We then use another function to render this data onto the screen in an organized way that makes it easy for the user to read.

Install installation instructions : this is a deployed application, so you just need to open up this application in the deployed link and it will take you to the application where you can fill out whichever city you would like

Locally: if you would like to run this application locally, you can simply this repo into your own VS code and then open the index HDMI file in the live server. You may also need to have your own API key for this application to work.

Sources: in this project, I did not have any starter court code nor is there any code taken from an outside repo however I did receive help from a tutor named Joan. able to create the user interface in the HD mount CSS to create a visually appealing UI for users however, I was having difficulty making the data from the API appear exactly where I wanted it however the tutor is able to help me with this and it is now working correctly. Another issue I had is that the temperature was being shown in kelvin as opposed to Fahrenheit, and I did not know how to change this however, the tutor was able to help me with this as well and now it’s more readable for users it’s notin Kelvin
